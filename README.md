# PLEY

PLEY is a YELP clone focused on providing the masses with a directory of local indoor basketball gyms with ratings and reviews.
It was built on ReactJS and allows users to add and delete gyms to the directory as well create, edit and delete reviews.

The backend was built on Postgresql and the frontend on React.js utilizing React-Redux.

The main components are the home page, which holds all listed gyms and the individual gym pages where the gym's address is 
provided as well as a list of previous reviews/ratings and the ability to post and edit one of your own. There is also a 
registration/login modal as well as a New Gym modal that a user can create a new listing with.
